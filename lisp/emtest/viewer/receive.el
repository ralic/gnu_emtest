;;$$IMPROVE ME Become smarter about aliases.  Pick the "best" one as
;;the id, favoring UUIDs (recognized as strings), allowing viewer's
;;recommendations and the test-runner's.  Try all aliases in deleting
;;it.

;;$$ADD ME suites (sometimes) indicate what their current children
;;are.  If other children are recorded, they no longer exist so remove
;;them.  Perhaps suite reports flag whether they have exhaustively
;;listed their children.
